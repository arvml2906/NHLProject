## 1. Data Acquisition

### Objective
In this first section, our objective is to indicate how to get NHL "data" loaded in the memory of a Jupyter notebook.
The "data" consists of all the "play-by-play" game events, for ALL NHL games of seaons 2016-2017 to 2023-2024 (including pre-season, regular and playoffs games!)
The "data" is loaded by a Python class; namely the NHLDataProvider class which is explained in the following sections.

### 1.1 The NHL API and understanding GAME_ID

In brief, to get the play-by-play data of a game, we need to send this GET command, where "GAME_ID" is a unique identifier of a NHL game.
```
https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{GAME_ID}/play-by-play
```

   - Figuring out Game IDs for each season:

      Since we have to download play-by-play events from each game (Regular and Playoffs) from seasons 2016-2017 to 2023-2024, we break-down the logic behind the naming of GAME_ID as mentioned in the follwing link :
      ```
      https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#game-ids
      ```
      In brief, suppose we take GAME_ID ``` 2019020901 ``` and GAME_ID ``` 2021030217 ``` , the breakdown from left to right would be as follows:

      ``` 2019020901 ```
      - '2019' for the season 2019-2020.
      - '02' for regular season.
      - '0901' for game number 901 in the regular season.

      ``` 2021030217 ```
      - '2021' for the season 2021-2022.
      - '03' for the playoff season.
      - '0217' -> For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7). (In this example: 7th game of match #1 in playoff round 2.)

### 1.2 Finding all game Ids of a season

To obtain all the gameIds for each season, our NHLDataProvider class uses the following important *private* methods:
   - ``` __find_game_ids_of_season(self, season)```
      - This method takes the season as input (ex: season=2018 for 2018-2019) and contains if-else blocks to compute all GameIDs (regular & play-offs) for each season and returns a complete list when called. This is to accomodate for changes in total number of regular games in some seasons, as shown in the figure below.

      <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_find_game_ids.png" alt="find_game_ids">


   - ``` ____game_id_gen_helper(self, start_game_id, end_game_id, season, gameids)```
      - This method stores the list of regular games, calls another helper method ```__playoff_rounds(self,season)``` to specfically aggregate the valid play-off GameIDs for the season, and returns a list containing all GameIDs for the season back to the ``` __find_game_ids_of_season(self, season) ``` method.

   - ``` __playoff_rounds(self,season) ```
      - This method aggregates a list of valid play-off round GameIDs for the season and returns it back to ``` ____game_id_gen_helper(self, start_game_id, end_game_id, season, gameids)```.

   The flow-diagram explains the working of these methods:

### 1.3 Understanding the NHLDataProvider Class and how it provides data
The NHLDataProvider class provides public methods to be accessed by the user to return raw data based on the user's needs. This data is returned either by fetching cached-data or by returning the downloaded data (using the NHL API) when the desired data is not in cache memory.

The initialiser of the NHLDataProvider class sets up the cache location as shown in the snippet below:

<img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_Class_init.png" alt="Class Init">

When the user needs the raw play-by-play data, the class provides two *public* methods as follows:
   - ``` get_game_data(self, season, game_id=None) ``` :
      - This method allows the user to obtain raw play-by-play data in two ways:
         - **Pass only season**:
         This option allows the user to obtain the raw data from by passing only the 'season' parameter (example: 2016 for 2016-2017 season). The method also checks if all of the data has been cached already, or if only some games have been cached. If not cached, it will download un-cached data to the desired path (*Base_Path*\Seasons\2016 for 2016-2017 season for example), and then finally returns the aggregated raw data of all play-by-play events for the season. The snippet below shows the code implementation of this scenario:

         <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_get_season_data.png" alt="Get season data fn">

         Execution in the notebook cell:
         <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_2017_season_data.png" alt="Get 2017 data">

         - **Pass season along with game_id**:
         This option allows the user to obtain the play-by-play raw data of a specific game, and it also checks if the game_id provided is a valid one. Just like the previous scenario, cached data is returned, else the data is downloaded and then returned.

         <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_get_game_data.png" alt="Get game data fn">

         Execution in the notebook cell:

         <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_get_raw_game.png" alt="Get raw game data">

   - ``` save_all_seasons_json(self) ``` :
      - This method allows the user to download all the play-by-play data from seasons 2016-2017 to 2023-2024 into appropriate cache paths, while ensuring cached data is not downloaded again. This does not return any data.

      <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_all_data_fn.png" alt="Get all data fn">

      Execution in the notebook cell:

      <img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_save_all_data.png" alt="Get all data snippet">

Furthermore, when a game is not cached in memory, the data to be retrieved using the API is called as shown in the following snippet:

<img src="/assets/images/DataAcq_API_Call.png" alt="API call">



Combining the information from **Section 1.2**, the following flow-chart explains well the Data Acquisition pipeline:

## 2. Interactive Debugging Tool
1. Implement an ipywidget (or interactive tool of your choosing) that allows you to flip through all of the events, for every game of a given season, with the ability to switch between the regular season and playoffs. Draw the event coordinates on the provided ice rink image, similar to the example shown below (you can just print the event data when there are no coordinates). You may also print whatever information you find useful, such as game metadata/boxscores, and event summaries (but this is not required). Take a screenshot of the tool and add it to the blog post, accompanied with the code for the tool and a brief (1-2 sentences) description of what your tool does. You do not need to worry about embedding the tool into the blogpost.
### Description of the Debugging Tool
We have implemented 3 widgets for the selection of the game ID: the first slider represents the year, the second, the type of game (regular season or playoffs), and the third, the specific game number. The user is able to select a specific game, and the information about the home team and away team will be displayed. Afterwards, they can choose to view a specific event in the game, where they will see the coordinates of the event on the rink, along with other relevant data obtained from the JSON files.

## 3. Tidy Data
1. In your blog post, include a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using head(10)). You can just include a screenshot rather than fighting to get the tables neatly formatted in HTML/markdown.
- Goals and shots dataframe <img src="/assets/images/tidy_data_g&s.png" alt="Goals and shots dataframe">
- Goals dataframe <img src="/assets/images/tidy_data_goals.png" alt="Goals dataframe">
- Shots dataframe <img src="/assets/images/tidy_data_shots.png" alt="Shots dataframe">
- Season info dataframe <img src="/assets/images/tidy_data_info.png" alt="Season info dataframe">

2. In a few sentences, discuss at least 3 additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset. We’re not looking for any particular answers, but if you need some inspiration, could a shot or goal be classified as a rebound/shot off the rush (explain how you’d determine these!) ?
   - According to the previsous game, indicate if a scoring/shooting player is in **hot/cold streaks**; e.g.,
     - if a player has scored more than 2 goals in the last 3 games, we can say that he is in a hot streak
     - if a player has not scored in the last 3 games, we can say that he is in a cold streak
   - According to the scoring difference, indicate the **game pressure** on a goal player
     - if the game scoring is over 2 goals, we can say that the player in behind-team is in a high pressure situation
   - According to the blocked shots in opposing team, indicate the **defensive pressure** on a goal player
     - if the opposing team has blocked more than n shots in the last 5 minutes, we can say that the player is in a high defence pressure situation

## 4. Simple Visualizations
### 4.1 Shot types
Important note: for this analysis, we have decided to drop shot types that have been used less than 0.1%, because they don't represent meaningful information, espcially when compared to other shot types.
The shot types drop were "between-legs" and "cradle", with 0.06% and 0.005% usage, respectively.

<img src="/assets/images/simple_viz_shot_types.png" alt="2023-2044 Season Shot Types Bar plot">
Above, we can see 2 bar plots presenting data for shot types of Season 2023-2024.
Each bar represent a shot type used by NHL players.

Bar plots are the best visualization method for this kind of data: we can clearly seperate the shot-types, while the height of each bar indicates relative information between them.


The top bar plot indicates how many shots and goals were made during the 2023-2024 Season. Note that bar height includes goals (red protion) and the sum of shot-on-goal and missed-shots (blue portion). We can clearly see that the wrist shot is the most used shot type.

The bottom bar plot indicates the percentage of goals for each shot type. From this second bar plot, we can draw interesting conclusions:
- In general, when a player makes a shot, he has around 8% chances to score a goal
- "Snap" shots are a mix of writst and slap shot. They are more effective (9%) than the wrist and slap shots (6% and 5% respectively). You can have more details about those shot types on the [Hockey Monkey](https://www.hockeymonkey.com/learn/types-of-hockey-shots) web site.
- The most dangerous types of shot seem to be "poke" and "bat" shot type. However, these 2 shot type are not well documented in most hockey analysis web site. We suppose this is because those shot-type are used based on specific opportunities during the game. This means that they happen more often by chance, than by choice of the player. If we concentrate our analysis on shot types selected by players, <u>the snap shot is the most dangerous shot type</u>.


### 4.2 Goal conversion rate vs distance
#### Statistics used
As for the previous section, we decided to use 3 types of events to calculate the "Goal Conversion Rate":
- Goal
- Shot-On-Goal
- Missed-Shot

The "Goal Conversion Rate" is the number of "Goals", divided by the sum of "Goals", "Shots-On-Goal" and "Missed-Shots".

Each of the 3 events contain coordinates of the origin of the shot (XCoord, YCoord). The coordindates are rounded to an integer value (feet).
The events also contain a field called "eventOwnerTeamId", so we can know which team was taking the shot.

#### NHL Coordinate system
The following image indicates the dimensions of an official NHL ice rink:
<img src="/assets/images/ice_hockey_layout.svg" alt="NHL ice rink layout">

We were able to decude the following informations:
- The origin (0,0) is located at the center of the ice
- The units of the coordiantes are in feet
- The rectangular size of the rink is 200'x85', so the coordinates go from Top-Left (-100, 42) to Botton-Right (+100, -42)
- The center of the goals are at: Left goal: (-89, 0)  Right goal: (+89, 0)

#### Challenge of calculating the distance
The distance of a shot is "simply" the Euclidean distance between the origin of the shot and the center of the target goal. However, there is challenge here: we have to find which of the 2 goals is the target goal!

For season 2020 and above, this was quite easy: each game contained a field "homeTeamDefendingSide". With this information, we could deduce which teamId was on which side at the beginning of the game.
For seasons 2019 and earlier, we found that we could look at the first event "shot-on-goal", for which the zone of "Offensive". For this shot-on-goal, we look at the XCoord value. If it was positive, it meant that the team taking the shot was aiming at the goal on the right side of rink.

Now that we knew on which side was the "Home Defending Side" at the beginning of the game, we had to be careful to switch the goal side at each period!

#### Invalid events
When we have parsed the data for seasons 2018, 2019 and 2020, we discovered that some events had bad data. For example, sometimes, the coordinates were missing or had Nan values. Since this represented less than 1% of the events, we decided to just drop those events to complete our analysis.


#### Results
<img src="/assets/images/simple_viz_goal_conversion.png" alt="Goal Conversion Rate for Seaons 2018, 2019 and 2020">

As we can clearly see, the goal rate is inversly proportional to the distance to the goal
The results are very similar from one season to another. The reasons are simple:
- The NHL rules have not really change over these seasons
- We have a lot of data points for each seasons, so the distribution is very well reprenseted.

The methodology we used to produce this graph is:
- We divided the distance into 35 regions, from 0 to 70 feet (2 feet resolution)
- For each region, we calculated the goal conversion rate
- For each season, we draw a line joining the 35 points of the goal conversion rates.

#### Filtering shots "too far"
When we started to analyze the results, we found out that shots taken from a distance higher than 70 feet had a "noisy" goal conversion rate. Sometimes, the rate seemed to be higher than shots taken from much closer to the goal.
After digging, we understood that
- The goals from distance above 70 (roughly, outside the offensive zone) are rare (< 1 %)
- Those goals were mainly scored in a empty net

So, we decided to remove those goals from our final result graph, because they introduce noise and don't give meaningful information


### 4.3 Shot vs distance and shot-type
3. Combine the information from the previous sections to produce a figure that shows the goal percentage (# goals / # shots) as a function of both distance from the net, and the category of shot types (you can pick a single season of your choice). Briefly discuss your findings; e.g. what might be the most dangerous types of shots?


## 5. Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps
# testing plotly
{% include plotly_test.html %}
1. Export the 4 plot offensive zone plots to HTML, and embed it into your blog post. Your plot must allow users to select any team during the selected season.
   Note: Because you can find these figures on the internet, answering these questions without producing these figures will not get you any marks!

2. Discuss (in a few sentences) what you can interpret from these plots.

4. Consider the Colorado Avalanche; take a look at their shot map during the 2016-17 season. Discuss what you could say about the team during this season. Now look at the shot map for the Colorado Avalanche for the 2020-21 season, and discuss what you could conclude from these differences. Does this make sense? Hint: look at the standings.

5. Consider the Buffalo Sabres, which have been a team that has struggled over recent years, and compare them to the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team which has won the Stanley for two years in a row. Look at the shot maps for these two teams from the 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons. Discuss what observations you can make. Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles? How complete of a picture do you think this paints?
