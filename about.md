  This website hosts a Blog for the Team B-04 of course IFT-6758, Fall 2024 Semester. 
</p>

During the course of [IFT-6758B](https://fracturedplane.notion.site/Data-Science-Course-IFT6758B-93594658bb7b4c42a7c705ce2e70c4a4), we are asked to build a Blog website. This Blog is a better (and more fun!) way to produce our reports for the pratical projects of the course.  
During this semester, we will be producing 3 blog posts; one for each milestone of the project.

## Team B-04
- Yue Xin Li
- Yihang Huang
- Serge Malo
- Arvind Nair

## NHL DATA
We thrilled to work on a project that uses data from the [National Hockey League](https://nhl.com)!
